	volume = {113},
	abstract = {While many potential fuel cycles have been evaluated for their equilibrium properties, there has been less investigation into the properties of transitions from the current once-through light water reactor (LWR) fuel cycle to other candidate fuel cycles.  This work describes a transition analysis performed using black-box optimization techniques coupled with the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator on large scale computing resources.  A transition deployment schedule for thermal and fast reactors was computed by wrapping Cyclus simulations inside an external optimizer.  The resulting deployments provide an approximate optimal solution for the fastest way to transition to an EG23-like fuel cycle without forced early retirement of reactors (for the utilized objective function). Although only reactor deployments are looked at here, the optimization workflow developed is flexible enough to handle deployment of an arbitrary number of facility types. The optimization runs were performed on the HT Condor high throughput computing infrastructure at University of Wisconsin-Madison.  Optimization tools were developed that are robust against failures and instability in the cluster environment.  The optimizer used is a hybrid of particle swarm and modified pattern search algorithms based on PSwarm. It is robust against failed simulations and objective function evaluations and is easy to parallelize.},

	abstract = {Simulation of the nuclear fuel cycle can be performed using a wide range of techniques and methodologies. Past efforts have focused on specific fuel cycles or reactor technologies. The CYCLUS fuel cycle simulator seeks to separate the design of the simulation from the fuel cycle or technologies of interest. In order to support this separation, a robust supplyâ€“demand communication and solution framework is required. Accordingly an agent-based supply-chain framework, the Dynamic Resource Exchange (DRE), has been designed implemented in CYCLUS. It supports the communication of complex resources, namely isotopic compositions of nuclear fuel, between fuel cycle facilities and their managers (e.g., institutions and regions). Instances of supply and demand are defined as an optimization problem and solved for each timestep. Importantly, the DRE allows each agent in the simulation to independently indicate preference for specific trading options in order to meet both physics requirements and satisfy constraints imposed by potential socio-political models. To display the variety of possible simulations that the DRE enables, example scenarios are formulated and described. Important features include key fuel-cycle facility outages, introduction of external recycled fuel sources (similar to the current mixed oxide (MOX) fuel fabrication facility in the United States), and nontrivial interactions between fuel cycles existing in different regions.},

	abstract = {The process of transitioning from the current once-through nuclear fuel cycle to a hypothetical closed fuel cycle necessarily introduces a much greater degree of supply feedback and complexity. When considering such advanced technologies, it is necessary to consider when and how fuel cycle facilities can be deployed in order to avoid resource conflicts while maximizing certain stakeholder values. A multiobjective optimization capability was developed around the {VISION} nuclear fuel cycle simulation code to allow for the automated determination of optimum deployment scenarios and objective trade-off surfaces for dynamic fuel cycle transition scenarios. A parallel simulated annealing optimization framework with modular objective function definitions is utilized to maximize computational power and flexibility. Three sample objective functions representing a range of economic and sustainability goals are presented, as well as representative optimization results demonstrating both robust convergence toward a set of optimum deployment configurations and a consistent set of trade-off surfaces.},
