%% Final Scientific/Technical Report

%% Content. The final scientific/technical report must include the following
%% information and any other information identified under Special Instructions on
%% the Federal Assistance Reporting Checklist:



%% 5. Summarize project activities for the entire period of funding, including
%%    original hypotheses, approaches used, problems encountered and departure
%%    from planned methodology, and an assessment of their impact on the project
%%    results. Include, if applicable, facts, figures, analyses, and assumptions
%%    used during the life of the project to support the conclusions.


%% 7. For projects involving computer modeling, provide the following information
%%    with the final report:
%%    a. Model description, key assumptions, version, source and intended use;
%%    b. Performance criteria for the model related to the intended use;
%%    c. Test results to demonstrate the model performance criteria were met
%%       (e.g., code verification/validation, sensitivity analyses, history
%%       matching with lab or field data, as appropriate);
%%    d. Theory behind the model, expressed in non-mathematical terms;
%%    e. Mathematics to be used, including formulas and calculation methods;
%%    f. Whether or not the theory and mathematical algorithms were peer
%%       reviewed, and, if so, include a summary of theoretical strengths and
%%       weaknesses;
%%    g. Hardware requirements; and
%%    h. Documentation (e.g., users guide, model code).

%% Electronic Submission. The final scientific/technical report must be submitted
%% electronically via the DOE Energy Link System (E-Link) accessed at
%% http://www.osti.gov/elink-2413.

%% Electronic Format. Reports must be submitted in the ADOBE PORTABLE DOCUMENT
%% FORMAT (PDF) and be one integrated PDF file that contains all text, tables,
%% diagrams, photographs, schematic, graphs, and charts. Materials, such as
%% prints, videos, and books, that are essential to the report but cannot be
%% submitted electronically, should be sent to the DOE Administrator at the
%% address listed in Block 16 of the Assistance Agreement Cover Page.

%% Submittal Form. The report must be accompanied by a completed electronic
%% version of DOE Form 241.3, “U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Announcement of
%% Scientific and Technical Information (STI).” You can complete, upload, and
%% submit the DOE F.241.3 online via E-Link. You are encouraged not to submit
%% patentable material or protected data in these reports, but if there is such
%% material or data in the report, you must: (1) clearly identify patentable or
%% protected data on each page of the report; (2) identify such material on the
%% cover of the report; and (3) mark the appropriate block in Section K of the
%% DOE F 241.3. Reports must not contain any limited rights data (proprietary
%% data), classified information, information subject to export control
%% classification, or other information not subject to release. Protected data is
%% specific technical data, first produced in the performance of the award that
%% is protected from public release for a period of time by the terms of the
%% award agreement. '
